# Getting Started

![Elasticshift Logo](logos/64x64.png) 

Elasticshift is a redefined build and deployment system that performs CI and CD efficiently in scale.

## What does this project do?
*The core idea of this project is to make universal ci and cd.*

## Why is this project useful?
Standadizing the build and no more rewriting build scripts, it has it's own format for better sharing and collaboration. ![Shiftfile](http://github.com/elasticshift/shiftfile)*
